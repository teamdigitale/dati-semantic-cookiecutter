# Template repository for semantic assets

This is a template repository for semantic assets to be harvested
by the National Data Catalog at https://schema.gov.it.

For further information on the Catalog, on how to use the portal 
schema.gov.it, and on contributing to its content, please refer 
to the [dedicated guide](https://teamdigitale.github.io/dati-semantic-guida-ndc-docs/).

## Repository layout and rules

This section describes the general layout of a semantic
repository.

All semantic assets are in the [assets](assets/) folder,
each asset type (e.g. ontologies, controlled vocabularies, schemas, ..)
has a proper sub-folder.

For readability:

- all json files are serialized as yaml;
- all RDF files are serialized as text/turtle;
- all semantic assets to be harvested/published are in assets/;
  files outside this directory should be safely ignored by other entities
  and are either used for testing or for developing and validating what's in assets/.

To delve deeper into the topic of the repository layout, the required content, 
the versioning of resources, and to consult some useful examples, please refer 
to the 
[dedicated section in the Operational Manual of the Catalog](https://teamdigitale.github.io/dati-semantic-guida-ndc-docs/docs/manuale-operativo/istruzioni-su-come-predisporre-il-repository-in-cui-pubblicare-le-risorse-semantiche.html).


## Automatic Checks and Tests

This section describes the automatic check and test procedures 
used to ensure the quality and integrity of the repository content.

The controls may be disabled if they are not applicable to your specific use case. For example, if you have already implemented a solution for stable URIs, the check on the equality between the names of files and related folders and the check between the names of files and related resources in URIs can be commented out.

### Automatic Checks (Pre-commit)

This repository uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) 
for automatic checks. The checks are specified 
in the [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](.pre-commit-config.yaml) file.

These checks can be run via GitHub Actions. 
The `validate.yaml` file in `.github/workflows` 
automatically enables pre-commit checks after each push or pull request (PR). 
You can also run them manually at any time.

To enable pre-commit checks in another repository, 
copy the [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](.pre-commit-config.yaml) file 
and the [`.github/workflows/validate.yaml`](.github/workflows/validate.yaml) file.

### URL Tests

The `test_urls.py` script in the `tests` directory verifies 
GitHub-related URLs in the `assets` subdirectory files.

This test can also be automated using GitHub Actions. 
The `test.yaml` file in `.github/workflows` 
automatically runs the tests after each push or pull request. 
You can also run them manually at any time.

To enable URL tests in another repository, 
copy the [`/tests/test_urls.py`](/tests/test_urls.py) file 
and the [`.github/workflows/test.yaml`](.github/workflows/test.yaml) file.

### Local Checks and Tests

Checks and tests can also be run locally 
using Docker or Python. Use `docker-compose` 
to replicate the CI pipeline:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-test.yml up
```

Note: To transfer this environment to another repository,
include the Dockerfiles in the `tests` directory
(such as `Dockerfile.precommit` and `Dockerfile.pytest`).
